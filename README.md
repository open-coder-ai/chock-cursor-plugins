</p>

An agent running in your editor can already touch your shell, your git history, and your CI
config. You want it to move fast without being the reason a stray `terraform destroy`
actually happens. Telling it to be careful in a prompt is not a guarantee; a plugin that can
refuse the command is closer to one — a matched destructive command is denied in the editor
before it runs, witnessed on a real Cursor install (2026-08-24), with benign commands in the
same session still allowed.

## Install

Cursor reads this repository as a plugin marketplace via `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```
# Team marketplace: Dashboard -> Plugins -> Add Marketplace -> Import from Repo
#   https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-cursor-plugins
# Local install of one plugin (developer flow):
#   copy cursor/<plugin-id>/ to ~/.cursor/plugins/local/<plugin-id>/ and reload Cursor
```

## What you get

Guard policies ship the hook, a guard script, and a stdlib-only adapter, and are
session-enforced: the hook returns Cursor's `permission: "deny"` response and the command is
refused. This needs `python3` and a usable `bash` on PATH — without them the hook fails
**open**, and every guard's description says so verbatim. Advisory policies are a skill the
client reads; nothing stops a violation. See **[PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md)** for the full list:
each policy, its version, and whether it enforces or advises in this client.

## Generated from chock-catalog

Every file here is compiled from policy sources in
[chock-catalog](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog) by
[chock](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock). Pull requests against this repository are
closed automatically — open them against the catalog instead.

- **Generated only:** CI regenerates from the pinned catalog and fails on any difference.
- **Byte-identical guards:** guard scripts and the hook adapter are verbatim copies of their
  framework sources.
- **Best-effort, not a boundary:** guards are pattern-based filters; see
  [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **Tested upstream, and gated:** every policy ships an eval suite
  (`base/<policy>/evals/suite.yaml`) in the catalog, and the publish workflow runs
  `chock check` and `chock check --only evals` before packaging anything — a policy whose
  evals fail cannot reach this repository. The tests live in the catalog because the policy
  source does; this repository is compiled output.
- This README is the exception: the one hand-written file in this repository, so it alone
  sits outside the generated-only guarantee.

### Verify it yourself

Nothing above asks for trust that cannot be checked. This rebuilds the published tree from
source and compares it with what is committed here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-cursor-plugins dist
git clone --branch v0.7.0 https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock framework
git clone https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog catalog
pip install ./framework
chock plugin build --repo catalog --policies-dir base --format cursor --out-dir dist
chock marketplace build --dist dist --tree cursor
git -C dist diff --exit-code && git -C dist status --porcelain
```

Silence from both `git` commands means this repository is byte-identical to a fresh build
from the catalog. `--branch v0.7.0` is the framework release this tree was published from.
`chock-market.lock` records a sha256 per published plugin directory, so one package can be
checked without rebuilding the rest.

**If you are listing these plugins in a marketplace,** pin both a tag and the full commit
SHA. The tag names the release; the SHA is what holds the reviewed bytes still.
