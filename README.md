<p align="center"><sub>The demo is Chock installed in a repository, refusing at commit. The packages here are the
other half — the same policies inside Cursor, refusing at the agent's own hooks. Of the five
guards shown, <code>scan-secrets</code> and <code>block-invisible-unicode</code> are packaged here.</sub></p>

**Your coding agent has a shell, your git history and your cloud credentials.** Chock refuses the
dangerous action before it lands — as a git hook, a CI gate, or the agent's own pre-tool hook.
This repository is the third of those, packaged for Cursor. A rule an agent reads is
advice; a hook that refuses the call is a control. Guardrails, not guarantees.

An agent running in your editor can already touch your shell, your git history, and your CI
config. You want it to move fast without being the reason a stray `terraform destroy`
actually happens. Telling it to be careful in a prompt is not a guarantee; a plugin that can
refuse the command is closer to one — a matched destructive command is denied in the editor
before it runs, witnessed on a real Cursor install (2026-08-24), with benign commands in the
same session still allowed.

## Install

Cursor reads this repository as a plugin marketplace via `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```
# Team marketplace: Dashboard -> Plugins -> Add Marketplace -> Import from Repo
#   https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-cursor-plugins
# Local install of one plugin (developer flow):
#   copy cursor/<plugin-id>/ to ~/.cursor/plugins/local/<plugin-id>/ and reload Cursor
```

## What these plugins refuse

**14 of the 26 packages here ship a real deny hook in Cursor; 12 are advisory.** Every package states its posture in this client in its own description, and
[PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) lists all 26 with versions.

- **guard** — `beforeShellExecution`: Cursor's `permission: "deny"`, the command is refused before it runs.
- **gate** — `preToolUse`, judging the file a write would create, then `stop`, re-reading what the
  turn left on disk.

|  | An agent settings file granting a bare-wildcard shell grant or allow-list | [`block-wildcard-agent-permissions`](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog/blob/main/docs/block-wildcard-agent-permissions/README.md) | ✓ gate | 17 |

| **Prompt injection** | Bidi override/embed/isolate controls (Trojan Source, CVE-2021-42574) and Unicode tag-block smuggling; ZWJ and bidi marks in real text still pass | [`block-invisible-unicode`](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog/blob/main/docs/block-invisible-unicode/README.md) | ✓ gate | 14 |
| **Secure code: Java** | `${}` in MyBatis SQL, unescaped template output, unsafe deserialization, wildcard CORS with credentials, wildcard actuator exposure, unverified JWT parse, request-chosen file paths — each rule allow · deny · ask in `.chock/security.json` | [`java-security`](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog/blob/main/docs/java-security/README.md) | ✓ gate | 115 |

<sub>Evals: cases in the policy's current suite in [chock-catalog](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog),
replayed in CI; the version packaged here is in [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) and can trail the

## How a refusal works in Cursor

Two kinds of package enforce here, at different events.

**Guard policies** ship a `beforeShellExecution` hook, a guard script and a stdlib-only
adapter. The hook returns Cursor's `permission: "deny"` response and the command is refused.
This needs `python3` and a usable `bash` on PATH — without them the hook fails **open**, and
every guard's description says so verbatim.

**Gate policies** judge what a turn writes, not what it runs. They ship the policy's gate and
its runner instead of a shell guard, wired at `preToolUse` — judging the file a write would
create, before it lands — and again at `stop`, re-reading what the turn actually left on disk.
They need `python3`; without it a fail-open client allows silently, but a gate that cannot
reach a decision refuses rather than allowing something it never judged. Cursor does not hold
the turn's end, so a refusal at `stop` is handed back to the agent as a follow-up message once.

Advisory policies are a skill the client reads; nothing stops a violation. See **[PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md)** for the full list:
each policy, its version, and whether it enforces or advises in this client.

A plugin governs one person's session in one client; it doesn't run in CI or travel with a
clone. For enforcement that follows the repository instead, install Chock directly:
`pip install chock && chock init && chock sync --ci`.

## Generated from chock-catalog

Every file here is compiled from policy sources in
[chock-catalog](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog) by
[chock](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock). Pull requests against this repository are
closed automatically — open them against the catalog instead.

- **Generated only:** CI regenerates from the pinned catalog and fails on any difference.
- **Byte-identical guards:** each guard script is a verbatim copy of its policy's source in the
  catalog, and the hook adapter a verbatim copy of its framework source.
- **Best-effort, not a boundary:** guards are pattern-based filters; see
  [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **Tested upstream, and gated:** every policy ships an eval suite
  (`base/<policy>/evals/suite.yaml`) in the catalog, and the publish workflow runs
  `chock check` and `chock check --only evals` before packaging anything — a policy whose
  evals fail cannot reach this repository. The tests live in the catalog because the policy
  source does; this repository is compiled output.
- This README is hand-written, as are `SECURITY.md` and the workflows under `.github/`, so they
  sit outside the generated-only guarantee.

### Verify it yourself

Nothing above asks for trust that cannot be checked. This rebuilds the published tree from
source and compares it with what is committed here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-cursor-plugins dist
git clone https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog catalog
git clone --branch "$(tr -d '[:space:]' < catalog/.framework-ref)" \
  https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock framework
pip install ./framework
chock plugin build --repo catalog --policies-dir base --format cursor --out-dir dist
chock marketplace build --dist dist --tree cursor
git -C dist diff --exit-code && git -C dist status --porcelain
```

Silence from both `git` commands means this repository is byte-identical to a fresh build
from the catalog. The framework ref comes from the catalog's own `.framework-ref`, which is
what the publish and Generated-only workflows read, so this recipe cannot drift from the
release a tree was actually built with.
`chock-market.lock` records a sha256 per published plugin directory, so one package can be
checked without rebuilding the rest.

**If you are listing these plugins in a marketplace,** pin both a tag and the full commit
SHA. The tag names the release; the SHA is what holds the reviewed bytes still.
