# Block Unapproved Egress

Best-effort guard against exfiltration through the tool channel: a network command (curl/wget/Invoke-WebRequest) that UPLOADS data -- POST/PUT, --data/--form, --upload-file, --post-file -- to a host outside the egress allowlist. The allowlist defaults to package registries and code hosting and is meant to be extended with your org's own domains; a host matches by exact name or ".<entry>" suffix. Fetch-only traffic is left alone. A schemeless or protocol-relative target is checked too, from the last non-flag token, but only when no explicit http(s):// URL appears -- once one has, it alone decides. Options are parsed as curl reads them, so -sd @file is an upload. Tool-time FLOOR, not a network sandbox. Known bypasses: ~/.curlrc, obfuscated payloads, non-standard clients, a language runtime. Escape: 'pragma: allowlist egress'.

```
block(egress): fetch(curl|wget|iwr) + upload(-d|--data|-F|--upload-file|-X POST|PUT) to host NOT in allowlist
allow: fetch_only(GET), allowlisted_host(github|pypi|npm|...); floor_not_sandbox; escape: 'pragma: allowlist egress'
```

This policy is enforced in Cursor by the beforeShellExecution hook shipped with this plugin, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide enforcement across every commit and in CI still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
