# Block Destructive Commands

Best-effort guard against destructive commands: rm -rf targeting absolute, home ($HOME/~) or root-adjacent paths (and the PowerShell Remove-Item -Recurse equivalent); git push --force (not --force-with-lease); git reset --hard; git clean -f; kubectl delete; terraform destroy; aws s3 rm --recursive / rb --force; dropdb; helm uninstall/delete; docker volume rm/prune and system prune; gcloud ... delete. Destructive verbs are matched position-aware, so a bucket, path or object NAMED like a verb (aws s3 cp ... rm, docker volume inspect rm, helm list delete) is allowed. Known bypass classes include aliases, quoted arguments, non-standard clients, and scripts that invoke these commands indirectly. This is friction, not a security boundary.

```
block(destructive_command @position-aware): rm_-rf(/|~|$HOME|.)|Remove-Item_-Recurse, git_push_--force, git_reset_--hard, git_checkout_., git_clean_-f, kubectl_delete, terraform_destroy, aws_s3(rm_--recursive|rb_--force), dropdb, helm(uninstall|delete), docker_volume(rm|prune)|system_prune, gcloud_delete

This policy is enforced in Cursor by the beforeShellExecution hook shipped with this plugin, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide enforcement across every commit and in CI still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
