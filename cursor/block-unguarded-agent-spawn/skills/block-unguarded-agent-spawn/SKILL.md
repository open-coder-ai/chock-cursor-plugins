# Block Unguarded Agent Spawn

Best-effort guard against an agent launching a coding agent with its safety checks off: claude --dangerously-skip-permissions or --permission-mode bypassPermissions, codex --full-auto, --yolo, --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox or --sandbox danger-full-access, gemini --yolo, -y or --approval-mode yolo, cursor-agent --force. A spawned agent that never asks and never sandboxes is an unsupervised agent (OWASP ASI10, rogue agents). Read as a parsed command, so `cd repo && claude ...`, `bash -c '...'`, sudo/env wrappers and `npx @openai/codex ...` are caught, while a normal invocation, `codex --sandbox workspace-write`, or a command that only mentions the flag (echo, grep, a commit message) is not. Known bypass classes include shell aliases, wrapper scripts, config files that set the mode, and agents this list does not name. Run the agent with its default approvals; a human decides when an unattended run is acceptable.

```
never(spawn_agent): claude(--dangerously-skip-permissions|--permission-mode_bypassPermissions), codex(--full-auto|--yolo|--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox|--sandbox_danger-full-access), gemini(--yolo|-y|--approval-mode_yolo), cursor-agent(--force)
if(unattended_run_needed): propose_to_human; await(approval)  # spawn with default approvals and sandbox
```

This policy is enforced in Cursor by the beforeShellExecution hook shipped with this plugin, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide enforcement across every commit and in CI still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
