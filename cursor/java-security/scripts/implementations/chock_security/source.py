"""Java and Kotlin source as a rule should read it: code only, comments and literal contents blanked.

A quality rule matching `==` or `catch (` against raw text fires inside a comment, a Javadoc
example or a string literal, and a guard that refuses a comment is noise. `code()` returns the
file line for line -- the same count, so a finding's line number is the author's -- with every
comment replaced by spaces and every string, text block and char literal kept as its quotes
around blanks: `"a == b"` reads as `"      "`. Columns are preserved too.
