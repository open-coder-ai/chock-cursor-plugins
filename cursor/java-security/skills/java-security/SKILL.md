# Java Security Rules

trigger: writing Java or Kotlin -- Spring, Jakarta EE, Struts, Quarkus, Micronaut, Vert.x or Android -- SQL, JPA or MyBatis, Thymeleaf, JSP, JSF or FreeMarker templates, application.properties or .yml, web.xml, pom.xml or Gradle builds; "customize java security" opens this skill's guided page. avoid: injection (SQL, command, code, SpEL, LDAP, XPath, template), XXE, SSRF, unsafe deserialization, path traversal and zip slip, weak crypto and trust-all TLS, disabled Spring Security protections, exposed secrets and actuator data, known-exploited dependency versions, exported Android components; and the bugs, leaks and style breaches SpotBugs, Sonar, PMD and Checkstyle report. 129 rules in 16 packs -- security: java, crypto, spring, jakarta, persistence, templates, logging, build, android; quality: bugs, concurrency, resources, exceptions, performance, style, testing -- each rule or pack allow|deny|ask in .chock/security.json; absent = deny.

```
on(commit|tool_use): block(script) script=java-security-gate.py
java-security: a construct one of its rules denies -- the refusal above names the rule, the pack it belongs to and the fix. Each rule's verdict is allow|deny|ask in .chock/security.json, per rule or per pack (java, crypto, spring, jakarta, persistence, templates, logging, build, android, bugs, concurrency, resources, exceptions, performance, style, testing); absent = deny. Only what the change adds is refused: a violation on lines the change leaves alone never blocks it. Only a human reviewer waives a line, with // chock: allow <rule-id>, never the agent: in the agent a waiver counts once a human has committed it. Choose verdicts by asking to customize java security, which opens this skill's guided page.
```

## Guided setup

Asked to customize, configure, set up, review or change these rules -- "customize java
security" and anything meaning it -- open the guided page rather than asking the questions
as prose. Open it unasked, once, when Java is about to be written and no selection file
exists at either scope: every rule denies until someone chooses, and the page is a better
first meeting than the refusal. It is `setup.html`, in this skill's own directory beside this file and
`references/`. It is offline and writes nothing itself; deny is preselected for every rule,
and a verdict is chosen, never derived from a question about the stack. It asks once per pack --
java, crypto, spring, jakarta, persistence, templates, logging, build, android -- so a team
switches off a stack it does not run in one answer, and opens a pack's rules only when asked.

Where this client can publish an Artifact, publish that file as one, declaring
`capabilities: {db: {}}`, and let the person walk it in the panel. Their Submit writes the
result to the artifact's own store at `selection/current`; read that document back.
Everywhere else, open the page in a browser and take the result from their clipboard.

`result.selection` is the whole file and `result.wiring.scope` says where it goes:

- `repo`: `.chock/security.json` at the repository root, committed; where chock is
  installed there, `chock sync --repo .` afterwards.
- `user`: `~/.chock/security.json`, the floor for work outside a repository that carries its
  own. A repository carrying `.chock/security.json` governs itself: refuse the user-scope
  write, say so, and offer to change the committed file in a pull request.

Show the person one row per rule before writing, and overwrite an existing selection only
after they have seen the diff. Never write a pattern, severity or path into the file: it
carries verdicts only, and the gate refuses anything else at the next write. Reach for the
text walk -- `references/setup-contract.json`, one rule at a time, deny unless told
otherwise -- only where the page cannot be shown at all.

Wiring is not this skill's. Installed as a plugin, the hooks beside this file judge each
write and the turn's end; in a repository, `chock sync` adds the commit hook. Both read the
same selection file.

This policy is enforced in this client by the PreToolUse and Stop hooks installed with the plugin, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide enforcement across every commit and in CI still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
